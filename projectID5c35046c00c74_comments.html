<HTML><BODY>An interesting history of the typewriter, complete with numerous pictures of really early models, produced on the occasion of its 50th birthday in 1923. Interesting how this device very rapidly changed society, and even more rapidly disappeared from our society with the rise of the PC.

<p>A few pages may cause some difficulties. If the text inside some of the illustrations can easily be transcribed, please do so; if the text in illustrations is hard to read, don't bother. Please transcribe the sentence in typewritten scripts in many languages when it is in Latin (and Greek) script. I will take care of the non-Latin scripts during PP.

<p>Have fun!
